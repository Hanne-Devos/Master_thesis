First exploration of data.

- amount of projects
- coverage of tissues on phosphoprotein and -site level
- investigation of enrichment
- amount of STY sites
- repeat of analysis on organ system level
- non-canonical sites: where does the loss come from?

WP1:
- classification of proteins and phosphosites in three categories
- exploration of tissue aspecific phosphorylated proteins and phosphosites
- loss when considering only STY-sites
- non-tissue-specific phosphorylated proteins having tissue-specific phosphosites
- exploration of patterns (continued in WP1_patterns)
