An analysis of a tissue-specific phosphorylation and phosphosite mutation map of the human proteome

This repository contains the code used for my master thesis, titled an analysis of a tissue-specific phosphorylation and phospho-site mutation map of the human proteome. RAW MS data was retrieved from PRIDE repository and reprocessed using ionbot (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.02.450686v2) (https://ionbot.cloud) from the CompOmics group (https://www.compomics.com), under supervision of prof. dr. Lennart Martens and Pathmanaban Ramasamy. Manutal tissue annotation was retrieved by Tine Claeys.

I'm gratefull to the entire CompOmics group as part of the VIB-UGent Centre for Medical Biotechnology, Ghent University and prof. dr. Lennart Martens and Pathmanaban Ramasamy in particular.
